## Week 4

## week recap
from this week I learn how to used JavaScript arrays and for loops to iterate over these arrays and dynamically generate content. Additionally, I learned to use various DOM methods to access and modify existing HTML elements. And also added event listeners to ensure that JavaScript runs only after the DOM is fully loaded.
